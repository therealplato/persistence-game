#persistence-game
AppGyver/Angular app to track your persistence over time  
Use it to keep track of and improve your habits

##Try my AppGyver deployment:

Install AppGyver Scanner ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.freshandroid) | [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515?mt=8)), then scan the code at https://share.appgyver.com/?id=67861&hash=1c1f536a281d991a98efa9a01ce66f04c317f86ad2d380ee02515ca0a7eb6695

##Try it on your localhost:
Install AppGyver Scanner ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.freshandroid) | [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515?mt=8)), then

    $ git clone https://github.com/therealplato/persistence-game; cd persistence-game
    $ npm install -g steroids
    $ steroids connect

then find and scan the QR code in your browser tab

##Try a binary:
I havent done this for this repo, but you would deploy your app to the AppGyver cloud, then use their build service to build an APK or ios binary, download it, and install to the phone
